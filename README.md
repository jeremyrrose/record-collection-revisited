# Record Collection Revisited

Your uncle was so pleased with the record collection app you built that he has started telling *everyone* that you are a computer genius. At this point, your cousin, your grandma, and your uncle's ex-wife have all asked you if you can build a record collection app for *them*.

**DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF**, you explained to each of them. But the thing is, each of them *did* send you a $20 check for your high school graduation... so you're kind of obligated.

But it would be a violation of your DRY ethos to re-deploy an individual app to Heroku for each of them so that each could have their own database. You need user logins. You'll have to rebuild the whole thing.

Fortunately, you just learned Rails -- and Alex says you can build a whole Rails server in 15 minutes, right? You've also got a bunch of talented classmates, and you've decided to make this one a group effort.

You'll test it out using the same eight classic LPs, since you already typed out all the info:

You're kinda weirded out by the fact that you now think Hall & Oates' "I Can't Go For That" totally *SLAPS*, but whatever. This isn't about your uncle anymore, or about Hall & Oates -- this is about software engineering.

Gather your group and [let's get started](StepOne.md).
